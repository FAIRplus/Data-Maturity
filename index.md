# FAIRplus Dataset Maturity (DSM) Model  

The FAIRplus-DSM model is intended as a comprehensive reference model for state-of-FAIRness improvement in research datasets. Based on the FAIR guiding principles, the DSM model defines and classifies requirements that constitute an incremental path towards improving FAIRness level for a given research dataset.

The model is comprised of three categories of requirements as described below. These requirements are prescribed by a set of [indicators](docs/Indicators.md) defined for each level.

- **Content-related**: What is reported in the dataset & the metadata.
- **Representation and format**: How the data object & metadata object are represented and formatted.
- **Hosting environment capabilities**: What capabilities of the hosting environment that enables and supports the use of FAIR data.

# Maturity levels  

The FAIRplus-DSM model presents five levels of FAIR. Each level is characterised by by increasing requirements across the three categories of the FAIR requirements. The diagram below provides a summary description and perspective for each level.
