# Glossary terms

### Common Data Element
A common data element are standardized key terms or concepts, established so that they may be used in studies, to enhance data quality and reusability over time.

### Community-defined data reporting guidelines
A community-defined data reporting guideline is a well-defined data format or document that provides information on data achiving and sharing across the community. Most of the community defined guidelines can be found on [FAIRSharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard).

### Contextual Metadata
This is a type of metadata that describes the context in which the dataset was produced within.  Contextual metadata is necessary to preserve the integrity of the data and provides the means to understand and enable the interpretation of the data to anyone wishing to use this data. In the biomedical domain, this information includes concepts that make up the study design such as the assessments or assays that generated the data, as well as the entities that data is collected for such as subjects, samples, cell lines, or molecular entities and the relationships between them. 

### Controlled terminologies
A controlled terminology is an organized list of terms for the purpose of curation and normalization of data record annotation. Hence, they are list of indexed terms that can be retrieved by simple browsing and querying.

### Data Dictionary
A data dictionary is a document systematically listing and defining the all data variables recorded / used in a dataset. data variable definition includes provide *Term metadata*, which describe the entity, but also allowed values for that variable, which are know a variable value sets.

### Data Discovery
Data discovery involves the collection and evaluation of data from various sources and is often used to understand trends and patterns in the data. It requires a progression of steps that organizations can use as a framework to understand their data.

### Data Searching
Data searching is the process of finding relevant information from the data in a systematic manner.

### Data Element Level
The data element level is the smallest unit of data and is descibed by a definite meaning and semantic.

### Data Exchange Model
A data exchange model is a type of data model specialized devised to enable the transfer of information between systems.

### Data Model/Schema
A data model is a formal representation of a domain with identified key entities and relations between them.

### Data Variable
A data variable is an information entity which can be defined in a data dictionary, which has a type and which can assume a range of values.

### Dataset
A dataset in the context of the FAIR-DSM model is a data structure that is purposed for FAIR sharing. A dataset in FAIR-DSM-L-1 is a flexible container for any collection of data that is expected to be hosted and served for FAIR data sharing, i.e., Datasets can contain unstructured (e.g., image files) or structured (e.g. clinical data or lab data) data.  Starting with FAIR-DSM-L-2 to FAIR-DSM-L-5, a dataset is expected to refer to a container for structured data, composed of a set of fields and each field is composed of a set of values (value set). In the majority of cases a dataset will be a tabular data structure (delimited text file) or a hierarchical data structure (json or xml)

### Dataset Descriptor
A data descriptor is a data structure that contains any information that describes the Dataset, i.e., it is the datas structure representing the dataset's metadata.

### Dataset Field
A dataset field is an attribute of the dataset, which may be defined in the dataset model.

### Dataset Field Values
Dataset field values is a collection of information entities which are allowed for a given dataset field.

### Dataset Model
A dataset model is a formal representation devised for a dataset.

### Domain Entity
A domain entity is a information element (a type, a concept) core to the description of a given knowledge area.

### Domain Model
The domain model is a  formal representation of a knowledge domain with concepts, roles, datatypes, individuals, and rules, typically grounded in a description logic.

### FAIR sharing
FAIR sharing is a data use case that is intended for a data object (dataset) to exhibit a state of FAIRness purposed for sharing and re-use.

### Field Level Metadata
The filed level metadata descibed in detail about the data stored in the field either based on the type of data, the usage of data, the data source etc.

### General Purpose Metadata Schema
Generalised schemas require limited time and expertise, but the description may be inadequate. They include what are considered the essential elements to describe any data. Such schemas usually not domain-specific.

### Generic Data Model
Generic data models are generalizations of conventional data models that define standardised general relation types, together with the data that may be related or connected by such a relation type.

### Indentifiable Dataset
Identifiable dataset is any information (personal or indirect) that can link a dataset to its research study.

### Key Master Data Entities
Definition

### Linked Data Representation
Definition

### Machine-Interpretable Format
Definition

### Machine-Readable Format
A machine readable format is a information representation specifying how to serialize (write) information/data in ways software agents can handle.

### Master Data Entity
The conceptual entity about which the observed or measured data is reported in the dataset(s). E.g., chemical compound, biospecimen, human subject, animal subject, cell-line.

### Metadata Record
A metadata record is an instance of a metadata schema denoting/describing an entity, digital or otherwise.

### Metadata Registry
Definition

### Metadata Schema
A metadata schema is a formal representation / specification which defines a set of descriptors needed to denote an entity.

### Minimum Information Reporting Guidelines
A minimum information reporting guideline consist of sets of guidelines and formats for reporting data derived by specific high-throughput methods. Their purpose is to ensure the data generated by these methods can be easily verified, analysed and interpreted by the wider scientific community.

### Ontology Terms
An ontology term is a entity defined in a semantic data model or a pre-defined ontology. it can be a Class/type or a Property/relation.

### Project Dataset
Definition

### Reference Data Entity
Definition

### Reference Field
Definition

### Reporting Guideline
A reporting guideline is a document, usually available as unstructure text, outlining annotation requirements in a specific domain for the purpose of data archiving, exchange and reporting.

### Resolvable Identifier
Definition

### Semantic Data Model
Semantic data model is a type of data model where all entities (classes and relations) are either defined as an ontology using formal semantics (ie the semantic data model is an ontology) or where all entities and relations between entities have been mapped to one or more ontologies.

### Standard Generic Dataset Model
Definition

### Structured Dataset
A structured dataset is a information object which is represented according to some principled ways, thus adding contraints and structure to information representation.

### Study Design
Definition

### Study Design Element
Definition

### Term Metadata
A term metadata refers to any descriptor of an entity.

### Tidy Data Principles
Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning). In tidy data, each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row and each type of observational unit forms a table.

### Value Level Metadata
