## Scoring
In all subchallenges the submitted predictions will be scored using the ground truth data. We utilize different scoring metrics in the different aims as described below.

- [Scoring subchallenge I](/docs/scoring/scoring_subchallenge_i)
- [Scoring subchallenges II and III](/docs/scoring/scoring_subchallenges_ii_iii)
- [scoring subchallenge IV](/docs/scoring/scoring_subchallenge_iv)

The following figure summarises which cell-lines are in used for scoring in each subchallenge.

_Figure 1. Overview on the data usage in the subchallenges. The data provided for training is in green and the requested data for the different aims in different colors. The full condition is growing in full media with no starvation. Missing data is in white and the normal cell lines used for calculating the ratio in the proteomic dataset are marked with “Normal”._
