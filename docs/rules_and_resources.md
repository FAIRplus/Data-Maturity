## Challenge Community Forum
We encourage people to visit the [Discussion Tab](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20366914/discussion/default) frequently. Except in the case of sensitive subjects, we request that all challenge-related questions be posed here, instead of through private discussion.

## Challenge Terms of Use
These data are provided exclusively for use within the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer Challenge.

Challenge participants must abide by the guiding principles for responsible research use and data handling within the Synapse Commons Platform as described in the Synapse Governance documents and by the [DREAM Challenges Official Rules](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn10144147/wiki/448310).

**Publication embargo:** The use of Challenge data or Challenge results in a publication, presentation or preprint by Challenge participants is not permitted until the Parties have jointly published an overview paper on the results from the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer Challenge and the best performing strategies used in the Challenge (the “Overview Paper”), unless the Overview Paper is not published within 2 years of the Challenge Launch. You will be contacted through your Synapse-affiliated email address when this condition has been met. This information will also be posted within the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer Challenge project.

**Acknowledgement:** Challenge participants are permitted to use, publish and present the Challenge data and Challenge results, after publication of the Overview Paper or the 2-year embargo period, provided they acknowledge Attila Gabor, Marco Tognetti, Bernd Bodenmiller, Julio Saez Rodriguez and Sage Bionetworks as follows: “The Datasets used for the analyses described in this manuscript (or publication) were contributed by Attila Gabor and Marco Tognetti. They were obtained as part of the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer Challenge through Synapse ID [synXXXX]”.

**Citations:** In recognition of the effort that the Contributing Study Investigators and their institutions have made in obtaining the data that were the basis for the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer Challenge, publications and presentation using the Challenge data must cite the Overview Paper.
