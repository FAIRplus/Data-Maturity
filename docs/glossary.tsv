Starting with FAIR-DSM-L-2 to FAIR-DSM-L-5, a dataset is expected to refer to a container for structured data, composed of a set of fields and each field is composed of a set of values (value set). In the majority of cases a dataset will be a tabular data structure (delimited text file) or a hierarchical data structure (json or xml)

Field level metadata	The filed level metadata descibed in detail about the data stored in the field either based on the type of data, the usage of data, the data source etc.		Yojana		
General purpose metadata schema	Generalised schemas require limited time and expertise, but the description may be inadequate. They include what are considered the essential elements to describe any data. Such schemas usually not domain-specific.
