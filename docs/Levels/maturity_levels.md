# FAIRplus-DSM Maturity levels

##FAIR Maturity Derived Goals 

### Level 1
As a researcher I want to publish my analysis-related data, making them Findable, Citable and available for re-use for purpose of future analysis validation

###Level 2
As a Project Data manager I want to standardise all project data outputs maintaining the relationship between the various data modalities within the context of the project, to preserve the data and support multiple analyses and multiple researchers in the project

###Level 3
As a project consortium, we want to guarantee long term preservation of our data and to be shared with the community; to enable re-purposing of our data and the ability to integrate with other data within the same domain / subject area. 

###Level 4
As a research institute, I want to build a FAIR Data Commons to be able to integrate and harmonise data of interest from different studies and different data resources for the purpose of using data in meta-analyses studies and cross-study analyses. 

##Level 5
As a data-driven enterprise, I want to be able to manage my research data assets for the purpose of supporting multiple researchers and implementation of common Data Governance policies.
