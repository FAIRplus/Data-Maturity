## DSM-1-R2

| Identifier | [DSM-1-R2](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/blob/master/docs/_indicators/DSM-1-R2.md) |
| ---------- | ----------|
| Name | Structured and/or Unstructured Data are organised into [Dataset](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset) \(s) created for the purpose of [FAIR sharing](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#fair-sharing) |
| Maturity Level | 1 |
| Category | Data Representation |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Description | This is a pre-requisite requirement to *define* the *unit* of data that is the subject-matter of the FAIRification process. This requirement requires the data managers to consider the form and the representation of data into [Datasets](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset) that are designed and purposed for sharing and re-use by users unfamiliar with the data. Once defined, a Dataset should be assigned an identifier as indicated by [DSM-1-C0](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Indicators/#DSM-1-C0), which then makes it an Identifiable Dataset. <br><br> What this requirement is trying to advice against are decisions to FAIRify data stored in databases according to a defined schema without defining the 'data exchange unit' that is meant for sharing and re-use. |
