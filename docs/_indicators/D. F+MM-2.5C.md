## F+MM-2.5C

| Identifier | [F+MM-2.5C](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/blob/indicator-definitions/docs/_indicators/D.%20F+MM-2.5C.md) |
| ---------- | ----------|
| Name | Dataset Field Values are standardized against a locally defined Data Dictionary within and across related datasets |
| Maturity Level | 2 |
| Category | Content and Context |
| Granularity Level | Dataset Field Values |
| Related FAIR Principle | F2. Data are described with rich metadata, R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes |
| Description | This is a **data-related requirement** that focuses on the consistency of a Dataset's textual content. This is also related to the 'accuracy' and overall consistency of data content within and across multiple related project datasets. Level 2 content standardisation is not required to comply with standard terminologies or ontologies. However, to achieve Level 2 content standardisation, textual values reported in text-based Dataset Fields are expected to be consistently reported using locally defined terms. These local terms are defined in a local Data Dictionary that ought to be reported as well as part of the content-related metadata (F+MM-2.6). |
