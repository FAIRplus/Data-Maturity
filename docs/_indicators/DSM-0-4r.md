| Name | [Dataset Descriptor](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset-descriptor) (metadata) is **NOT** available in a [Machine Readable Format](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#machine-readable-format) |
| Maturity Level | 0 |
| Category | Metadata Format |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. <br><br> This indicator refers to the necessity to establish machine-processable ***metadata*** objects. This is to avoid having metadata represented in PDFs or otherwise non-parsable formats. See [DSM-1-4r](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Indicators/#DSM-1-4r) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
