## DSM-2-2r

| Identifier | [DSM-2-2r](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/blob/master/docs/_indicators/DSM-2-2r.md) |
| ---------- | ----------|
| Name | Project collected Data are organized into structured Dataset(s) and conform to a locally defined [Dataset Model](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset-model) |
| Maturity Level | 2 |
| Category | Data Representation |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Description | This is a **data-modelling related requirement**. More specifically, this indicator focuses on the data model used to describe the structure of the Dataset which is the form that data is modelled against for the purpose of being utilized for FAIR sharing and re-use (DSM-2-1c). At Level 2, this model is simply a set of defined Dataset Types or Names and their respective Dataset Fields to be used consistently by all project related Datasets. <br> <br> This is often represented in the form of pre-defined templates that data owners define for their project data or made available by the data hosting environment to be used for importing and exporting the FAIRified Datasets. This is to guarantee a minimum level of consistency amongst similarly reported datasets, which directly affects the **storage** capability of the hosting environment. This consistency will enable the hosting environment to store and index multiple datasets against this locally defined dataset model and hence offer better searching and discovery capabilities. |
