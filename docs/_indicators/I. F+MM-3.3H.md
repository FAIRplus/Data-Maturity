## F+MM-3.H3

| Identifier | [F+MM-3.H3](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/I.%20F+MM-3.H3.md) |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Hosting environment offers Data Discovery capability |
| Maturity Level | 3 |
| Category | Hosting Environment related requirements |
| Capability | Searching Capability |
| Related FAIR Principle | F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier |
| Description | This indicator requires the hosting environment to offer enhanced data discovery capabilities. This can be achieved by linking multiple related datasets through an implementation of a common domain model (F+MM-3.R1), which allows users to search and find contextually-related datasets. Datasets at this level are expected to use annotated and described standardised Dataset Fields (F+MM-3.R2) and their content to use standardised value terms and concepts (F+MM-3.C2). The hosting resource should therefore capitalise on these rich annotations and allow users to search across datasets for concepts and standard terms in their content through the use of ontology-related query expansions.  |
