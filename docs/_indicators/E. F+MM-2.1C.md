## F+MM-2.1C

| Identifier | [F+MM-2.1C](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/E.%20F+MM-2.1C.md) |
| ---------- | ----------|
| Name | A [Domain Model](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#domain-model) describes the overall study design, the relationships between the [Project Datasets](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#project-dataset), the key entities reported within the [Project Datasets](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#project-dataset) and the relationships between them |
| Maturity Level | 2 |
| Category | Content and Context |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Related FAIR Principle | R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes |
| Description | This is a **metadata-related requirement** focusing on context and domain description. This is an entry level requirement to describe the 'Domain' of the data, which at this level might not be fully represented by either the hosting environment or an adopted standard (level 3). The Metadata Record should include information that can help a researcher understand the data context, especially in relation to the overall project or study design that this dataset belongs to as well as the entities that are represented by the dataset content. |
| Cross-reference FAIR indicators | RDA-R1-01M, FsF-R1-01MD  |
