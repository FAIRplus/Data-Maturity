| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. <br><br> This is indicator refers to a **foundational** requirement to *objectify* and organise 'FAIR-to-be' data into *units* of data that are purposed for FAIR sharing. FAIR-DSM model refers to a *unit* of FAIR data as a [Dataset](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset). See indicator [F+MM-1.2R](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/A.%20F+MM-1.2R.md) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
