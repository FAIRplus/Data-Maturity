## F+MM-0.4R

| Identifier | [F+MM-0.4R](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/0.F+MM-0.4R.md) |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Dataset Descriptor is **NOT** available in a [Machine Readable Format](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#machine-readable-format) |
| Maturity Level | 0 |
| Category | Metadata Format |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. <br><br> This indicator refers to the necessity to establish machine-processable ***metadata*** objects. This is to avoid having metadata represented in PDFs or otherwise non-parsable formats. See [F+MM-1.4R](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/A.%20F+MM-1.4R.md) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
