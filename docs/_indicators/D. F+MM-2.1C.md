## F+MM-2.1C

| Identifier | F+MM-2.1C |
| ---------- | ----------|
| Name | Project's structured Data are organized into identifiable structured Dataset(s) each assigned a unique Dataset identifier |
| Maturity Level | 2 |
| Category | Content and Context |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Related FAIR Principle | F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier |
| Description | This is a **data-related requirement** that builds up on Level one's F+MM-1.1C requirement. Level 2 data are expected to be structured data that are organised and structured into defined Datasets. This indicator makes this requirement explicit by identifying the subject matter as the 'Dataset' rather than a generic 'Data Object'. Also as the scope of Level 2 data is a project/study level, this level refers to multiple related Datasets that are expected to be shared together, hence a level of contextual metadata is expcted to be included in the Metadata Record (F+MM-2.2C) |
