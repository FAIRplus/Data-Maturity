| Description | The data object is assigned to a locally unique identifier such that it can be referenced unambiguously and therefore there are no two identical identifiers that identify the same data object at a project level. Locally unique means an identifier should be associated with only one resource in the local project. In level 1, it does not need to be globally unique. |
