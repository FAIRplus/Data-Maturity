## F+MM-0.3H

| Identifier | [F+MM-0.3H](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/2.F+MM-0.2H.md) |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Dataset's Metadata is NOT searchable via keywords or elements within the Descriptor  |
| Maturity Level | 0 |
| Category | Hosting Environment |
| Granularity Level | Search Capability |
| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. Although not deemed as an essential requirement for FAIR Data accessibility, but Findability of data is dependent on some form of searching capabilities that allow users or machines to make use of the associated metadata to promote the Dataset's discoverability. <br><br> See [F+MM-1.4H](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/C.%20F+MM-1.4H.md) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
