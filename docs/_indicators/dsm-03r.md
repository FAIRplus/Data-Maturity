| Identifier | [dsm-03r](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/blob/master/docs/_indicators/dsm-03r.md) |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Dataset Metadata is **NOT** formally represented in a structured form, i.e. a [Dataset Descriptor](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset-descriptor) |
| Maturity Level | 0 |
| Category | Metadata Representation |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. This indicator refers to the absence of a structured object to contain the necessary and expected dataset metadata that will be required to reach higher levels of maturity. <br><br> See [dsm-10r](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Indicators/#dsm-10r) to be able to satisfy this prerequisite requirement.   |
