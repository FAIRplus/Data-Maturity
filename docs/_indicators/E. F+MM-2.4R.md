| Description |  This is a **data-related formatting requirement**. The exchange format used to share the Dataset(s) should be readable by machines. This is not a requirement to use semantic representations, this is a simple requirement to use standard formats (e.g. CSV, JSON, XML or similar) for data exchanged via the relevant API (F+MM-2.2H). |
