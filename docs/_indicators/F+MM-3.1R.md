### F+MM-3.1R

| Identifier | F+MM-3.1R |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Project-level metadata is represented in compliance with a community defined standard Domain Model |
| Maturity Level | 3 |
| Category | Metadata Representation requirements |
| Granularity Level | Project-level |
| Related FAIR Principle | R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards, I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data |
| Description |  This indicator requires multiple-related datasets within a project to conform to a community defined domain model. This indicator does NOT require the Domain Model itself to be formally represented. In most cases, this requirement is satisfied, when datasets are deposited in public repositories, which will implement the standard domain model as their schema.   |
