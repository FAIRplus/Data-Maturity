## DSM-0-R5

| Identifier | [DSM-0-R5](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/blob/master/docs/_indicators/DSM-0-R5.md) |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Dataset(s) are **NOT** available in a [Machine Readable Format](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#machine-readable-format) |
| Maturity Level | 0 |
| Category | Data Format |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. <br><br> This indicator refers to the necessity of establishing FAIR *digital* objects and hence data should be available in a machine-processable format, which should not be a problem in today's research data. See [DSM-1-R5](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Indicators/#DSM-1-R5) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
