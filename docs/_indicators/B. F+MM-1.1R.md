## F+MM-1.1R

| Identifier | F+MM-1.1R |
| ---------- | ----------|
| Name | A Data Object is defined as the FAIR-to-be entity for the purpose of sharing and re-use  |
| Maturity Level | 1 |
| Category | Data Representation |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Related FAIR Principle | |
| Description | This is a pre-requisite requirement to define and identify the Data Object that is the subject-matter of the FAIRification process. This requirement requires the data managers to consider the form and the representation of the data object that is **purposed** for sharing and re-use by external users. Data objects can be unstructured (e.g., image files) or structured (e.g. clinical data or lab data). Once defined, this Data Object should be assigned an identifier (F+MM-1.1C), which makes it an Identifiable Object. What this requirement is trying to advice against are decisions to FAIRify data stored in databases according to a defined schema without defining the 'data exchange unit' that is meant for sharing and re-use.
| Cross-reference FAIR Indicators | NA |
