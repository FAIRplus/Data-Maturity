## F+MM-3.1R

| Identifier | F+MM-3.1R |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Hosting Environment's Data schema is formally represented in a Machine Readable Format |
| Maturity Level | 3 |
| Category | Metadata Representation |
| Granularity Level | Project-level |
| Related FAIR Principle | R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards |
| Description |  This indicator requires multiple-related datasets within a project to conform to a community defined domain model. This indicator requires the Domain Model itself to be formally represented and made available by the data hosting environment. In most cases, this requirement is satisfied, when datasets are deposited in public repositories, which will implement the standard domain model as their schema.   |
| Cross-reference FAIR indicators | RDA-R1.3-01M |
