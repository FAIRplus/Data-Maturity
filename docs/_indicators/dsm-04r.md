| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. <br><br> This indicator refers to the necessity to establish machine-processable ***metadata*** objects. This is to avoid having metadata represented in PDFs or otherwise non-parsable formats. See [dsm-14r](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Indicators/#dsm-14r) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
