| Identifier | [dsm-24c](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/blob/master/docs/_indicators/dsm-24c.md) |
| ---------- | ----------|
| Name | Where applicable, [Dataset Field Values](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset-field-values) are standardized against a locally defined [Data Dictionary](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#data-dictionary) within and across related datasets |
| Maturity Level | 2 |
| Category | Content and Context |
| Granularity Level | Dataset Field Values |
| Description | This is a **data-related requirement** that focuses on the consistency of a Dataset's textual content. This is also related to the 'accuracy' and overall consistency of data content within and across multiple related project datasets. Level 2 content standardisation is not required to comply with standard terminologies or ontologies. However, to achieve Level 2 content standardisation, textual values reported in text-based Dataset Fields are expected to be consistently reported using locally defined terms. These local terms are defined in a local Data Dictionary that ought to be reported as well as part of the content-related metadata (dsm-26c). |
