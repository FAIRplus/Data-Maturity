| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. <br><br> This indicator refers to the absence of one of the prerequisites of FAIR priniciples, which is to include in the metadata object (the [Dataset Descriptor](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset-descriptor)) a  reference to the Identifier assigned to the FAIR Data Object being described (the [Dataset](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#dataset)) See [F+MM-1.2C](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/B.%20F+MM-1.2C.md) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
