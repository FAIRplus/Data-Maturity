| Related FAIR Principle | I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles, R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards |
| Related F+MM Indicator| F+MM-3.5C|
| Description | This is a **data-related requirement** focusing on the standardisation of the terminologies used within and across related Datasets. This indicator focuses on the set of data values for a given dataset field. To promote interoperability and enable the hosting environment to carry out cross-study queries, dataset textual field values should be standardised against community-standard controlled terminology or ontologies.       |
