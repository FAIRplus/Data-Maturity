## F+MM-2.6C

| Identifier | [F+MM-2.6C](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/blob/indicator-definitions/docs/_indicators/D.%20F+MM-2.6C.md) |
| ---------- | ----------|
| Name | Metadata Record includes reference to the locally defined Data Dictionary  |
| Maturity Level | 2 |
| Category | Content and Context |
| Granularity Level | Dataset Field Values |
| Related FAIR Principle | F2. Data are described with rich metadata, R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes |
| Description | This is a **metadata-related requirement**. This indicator is related to F+MM-2.5C, which requires that textual data values used within and across related datasets should consistently reported using locally defined terms or values. In case of using numeric values instead of textual values, a data dictionary is needed to map these values and allow users to interpret the data. Therefore, a data dictionary that associated each Dataset Field with its associated list of permissible terms or values and their meanings should also be made available. This could either be represented inside the Metadata Record itself if the metadata schema allows (F+MM-2.3R), or otherwise represented separately.  |
