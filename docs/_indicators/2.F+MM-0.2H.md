| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. This indicator refers to a state of storage, but with no formal retrieval mechanism that is defined for data access. A simple URI for download over http is usually the basic requirement to satisfy.<br><br> See [F+MM-1.2H](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/edit/v0.3/docs/_indicators/C.%20F+MM-1.2H.md) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
