## F+MM-0.5R

| Identifier | [dsm-05r](https://github.com/FAIRplus/Data-Maturity/blob/master/docs/_indicators/dsm-05r.md) |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Dataset(s) are NOT available in a [Machine Readable Format](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Glossary/#machine-readable-format) |
| Maturity Level | 0 |
| Category | Data Format |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Description | This is a ZERO-LEVEL indicator, which indicates the absence of one of the essential requirements for a Dataset to reach minimum level of FAIRness (Level 1) according to the FAIR-DSM model. <br><br> This indicator refers to the necessity of establishing FAIR *digital* objects and hence data should be available in a machine-processable format, which should not be a problem in today's research data. See [dsm-15r](https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/docs/Indicators/#dsm-15r) to satisfy this prerequisite requirement. |
