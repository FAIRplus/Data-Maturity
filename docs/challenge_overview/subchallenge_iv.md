title: "Subchallenge IV: Predict the cell-line response. "
parent: Challenge Overview & Questions
---

Cell-lines tend to respond to the same perturbations similarly, however some cell-lines show distinct patterns. For example, some markers show an activated then relaxed response upon EGF perturbation, but in some a sustained activity is observed. This subchallenge aims at inferring the signaling dynamics in the presence and absence of drugs in different cell lines. We ask the participants to predict the distinct response of the cell-lines from the unperturbed data. For this, we selected five cell lines (see Figure 7) for which we provide measurements in unperturbed states only. This data includes proteomics, transcriptomic, genomics and base-line single cell (and median) phosphoproteomics measurements. Participants can use the perturbation data of other cell lines to build their models.

_Figure 7. Selected cell lines and data availability for subchallenge IV. Dark green conditions shows the data that is available for these cell-lines. The submissions are tested based on the data highlighted in light blue._

Here, we are interested in which dataset and which measures in it are important in predicting how a cell line signals. In the longer term, understanding the genotype-phenotype relationship on the signaling network level will be a significant step toward the clinical use of the patient’s genomic information to predict drug sensitivity in personalized medicine.

Please consult the “Templates for submitting the predictions” subsection to see the expected format of the submissions for this subchallenge.
