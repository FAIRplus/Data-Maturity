## Scientific Rationale
Cell signaling governs almost all activities of cells and perturbations in cellular signaling might lead to diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes. It underlies the ability of a cell to correctly respond to the microenvironment and is essential for tissue homeostasis. Importantly, cells respond differently to perturbation depending on their genomes, history, and microenvironment displaying large signaling cellular heterogeneity. This heterogeneity can lead to drug response differences. In cancer particularly, intratumor heterogeneity is a key contributor to therapeutic failure and drug resistance: often subpopulations do not respond to therapies and the tumor regrows. A better understanding of signaling and its heterogeneity might unlock better disease treatment (Yaffe, 2019).

Signaling networks are complex systems and might exhibit emergent non-intuitive properties. Hence, a system biology approach that combines computational and experimental tools is required (Bhalla and Iyengar, 1999; Koseska and Bastiaens, 2017). These require a large number of markers to be measured at the same time and often need large perturbation screens, and therefore are experimentally and computationally complex and expensive. In this Challenge, based on a large perturbation data set (~4’000 conditions divided across 67 cell lines), we want to address which information is essential and how well can we predict the signaling within a cell.
