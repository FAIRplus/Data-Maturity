## 3. Submit abstract for the DREAM conference

Every year, top performers are invited to present at the annual DREAM conference. To do so participants needs to provide abstracts into ezchair (an abstract collections software). This way as soon as best performers are identified, we can pull the relevant abstracts that have already been submitted to ezchair.
