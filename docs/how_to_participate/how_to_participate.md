## Step 2. Join or Create a Team

It is encouraged, but not required, to work on this challenge as a team.

### Create and Register a Team

Learn more about how to create a team. By default the participant who creates a team is the Team Captain and has the ability to invite and remove members. All team members need a Synapse account and must log into Synapse and accept the team invitation.

### Join an Existing Team

You may also request to join an existing team by requesting to join a team registered for the challenge. Visit the Participants and Teams page to see which teams have registered. Learn more about joining a team.

## Step 3. Access the Data

You can access the data once you've completed Step 1 above and accepted the conditions of use of the data. Learn more about the Data available.

## Step 4. Submission

There are two parts to the challenge submission for a participant to be eligible as a top performer.

1. A prediction file. View File Submission.
2. A public Synapse Project that contains a writeup of their methods and source code. (Submitted after the final submissions). View Writeup Submission.

If your submission will include files you need to upload to Synapse, you must be a Certified User.

Make sure to indicate whether you are submitting as an individual or a team. If submitting as a team, identify the team. **Once you have submitted as a Team, you may not submit as an individual and vice versa**.

After you submit, expect an email either indicating that your submission was submitted successfully or that your entry is considered invalid because of specific problems with your entry. If there is any problem with your submitted entry, a description of the problems (e.g. missing items) will be sent to you. Use this information to modify and resubmit your entry. These emails will be sent to the email address saved in your synapse profile (if you have not changed it, this is the email you used for registration). If you do not receive this email, check your spam folder.

## Step 5. Share Ideas and Ask Questions

The discussion forum should be used for:

* Any and all questions about the challenge
* Collaboration with other participants.
