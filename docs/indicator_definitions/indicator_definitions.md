# Indicator definitions

The indicators of the FAIRplus Dataset Maturity Model are designed to enable researchers in the life sccinces to measure dataset maturity using a finite set of dimensions in conjunction with maturity levels. The levels themselves are a collection of well defined indicators across each maturity dimension, thus enabling user to better understand in what aspects the dataset can be improved in terms of FAIR. This will eventually help the users to benchmark and visibly improve re-usability of their data assets and to increase discoverability, interoperability and overall machine actionability incrementally.
