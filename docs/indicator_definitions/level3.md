# Level 3

## Content

### F+MM-3.1C

| Identifier | F+MM-3.1C |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | The dataset is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier. |
| Maturity Level | 3 |
| Category | Content-related requirements |
| Granularity Level | Dataset |
| Related FAIR Principle | F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier |
| Description | This indicator only relates to the identification of the dataset as a whole. It adds 'global uniqueness' requirement to F+MM-1.1C. Global uniquness of the identifier is only relevant at this level, since data at this level is expected to be hosted by public repositories or community-level resources.     |

### F+MM-3.2C

| Identifier | F+MM-3.2C |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Data values are standardized against community standard controlled vocabularies and/or ontologies |
| Maturity Level | 3 |
| Category | Content-related requirements |
| Granularity Level | Dataset Field Values |
| Related FAIR Principle | I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles |
| Description | This indicator focuses on the set of data values for a given dataset field. To promote interoperability and enable the hosting environment to carry out cross-study queries, dataset textual field values should be standardised against community-standard controlled terminology or ontologies.       |

## Representation and format

### F+MM-3.1R

| Identifier | F+MM-3.1R |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Project-level metadata is represented in compliance with a community defined standard Domain Model |
| Maturity Level | 3 |
| Category | Metadata Representation requirements |
| Granularity Level | Project-level |
| Related FAIR Principle | R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards |
| Description |  This indicator requires multiple-related datasets within a project to conform to a community defined domain model. This indicator does NOT require the Domain Model itself to be formally represented. In most cases, this requirement is satisfied, when datasets are deposited in public repositories, which will implement the standard domain model as their schema.   |
| Related FAIR indicators | RDA-R1.3-01M |

### F+MM-3.2R

| Identifier | F+MM-3.2R |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Dataset structural representation conforms to a standard dataset model |
| Maturity Level | 3 |
| Category | Data Representation requirements |
| Granularity Level | Dataset-level |
| Related FAIR Principle | R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards |
| Description | This indicator requires the collection of data at this level to be structured and represented according to a community-defined standard or a domain-specific repository dataset model. This will guarantee a level of syntactic interoperability that will enable cross-study data indexing and discoverability.   |
| Related FAIR Indicators | RDA-R1.3-01D |

### F+MM-3.3R

| Identifier | F+MM-3.1R |
| --------- | ----------|
| Name | Dataset(s) available in machine readable community standard format relevant to the adopted domain and data model |
| Maturity Level | 3 |
| Category | Data Format requirements |
| Granularity Level | Dataset-level |
| Related FAIR Principle | I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards |
| Description |  Data should be made available in a file format that is backed by the research community to enable data sharing and reuse.     |
| Related FAIR indicators | RDA-I1-01D, FsF-R1.3-02D  |
