## Description

In level 1, data is identifiable as individual generic data objects that are described by generic metadata elements. Hosting environment offers limited retrieval capabilities.

This level prescribes the entry level requirements that all the higher levels will build up upon. It establishes basic requirements to enable 'Findability', 'Accessibility' with basic descriptive metadata that enables data users to interpret and understand the data object.

The first step to be at Maturity Level 1 is to define and identify the data object that is expected to be shared and re-used (i.e., the FAIR data object). Notice this level is referring to a Data Object rather than a Dataset. This is to imply that data at this level includes both structured and unstructured data. 

### Indicators

| Category | Identifier | Indicator description |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Content and Context | [F+MM-1.1C] | A defined Data Object purposed for sharing and reuse is assigned a unique identifier |
| Content and Context | [F+MM-1.2C] | Metadata Record includes Descriptive \[Dataset / Data Object] - level metadata  |
| Content and Context | [F+MM-1.3C] | Metadata Record includes Descriptive project-level summary information |
| Content and Context | [F+MM-1.4C] | Metadata Record contains access information for the Data Object |
| Representation and Format |  [F+MM-1.1R] | A Data Object is defined for the purpose of sharing and re-use |
| Representation and Format |  [F+MM-1.2R] | Representation of the Metadata Record conforms to a standard Metadata Schema (e.g. DCAT, DATS, DDI) |
| Representation and Format |  [F+MM-1.3R] | Metadata Record is available in Machine-Readable Format |
| Hosting Environment | [F+MM-1.1H] | Metadata hosting environment stores and maintains a defined Metadata Record for each identifiable Data Object |
| Hosting Environment | [F+MM-1.2H] | The Data Object and its Metadata Record are indexed and retrievable via unique and persistent identifiers |
| Hosting Environment | [F+MM-1.3H] | Retrieval of the Data Object and its Metadata Record utilises a standardized communication protocol that is open, free and universally implementable |
| Hosting Environment | [F+MM-1.4H] | Hosting environment offers the capability to browse and search contents of the Metadata Record  |
