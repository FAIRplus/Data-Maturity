## Description

This level of maturity is at **project level**. At this level, data objects within the project are structured in fields conforming a dataset. The datasets are consistently described against a locally defined schema, controlled vocabullaries, and hosted in an environment offering data catalogue level searching capabilities.

### Indicators

| Category | Identifier | Indicator description |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Content | [F+MM-2.1C] | The Data Object is a structured Dataset with identifiable dataset fields. |
| Content | [F+MM-2.2C] | Each individual data variable should be reported in a single Dataset Field, conforming a structured dataset. |
| Content | [F+MM-2.3C] | Metadata includes dataset field level metadata (e.g. field name, field description and type). |
| Content | [F+MM-2.4C] | Dataset field values are standardized against a locally defined dictionary of terms within and across datasets. |
| Representation and format |  [F+MM-2.1R] | Project-level metadata is defined and conforms to a locally defined Domain Model or schema linking data content across datasets. |
| Representation and format |  [F+MM-2.2R] | Metadata describing project datasets conforms to a Defined Standard Model (e.g. DCAT, DublinCore, BioSchemas). |
| Representation and format |  [F+MM-2.3R] | Dataset(s) available in machine readable format (e.g. CSV, JSON, XML, or similar). |
| Hosting environmnet capabilities | [F+MM-2.1H] | *Retrieval capability*:<br/> Data and Metadata exchange format is retrieved using API technologies (REST, RPC, GRAPHQL). |
| Hosting environmnet capabilities | [F+MM-2.2H] | *Search capability*:<br/> Metadata is registered or indexed in a searchable resource. Data can be retrieved via its metadata descriptive elements. |
| Hosting environmnet capabilities | [F+MM-2.3H] | The hosting environment offers meta-data archiving capability. |
